# Hot Iron Plate Alert System

## Overview
The **Hot Iron Plate Alert System** is a safety-based hardware project designed to prevent accidental burns caused by contact with a heated electric iron. The system detects both the temperature of the iron plate and the proximity of a hand, and triggers an audible alert when the surface is dangerously hot.

This makes it especially useful in homes, hostels, and shared spaces where accidental contact with hot appliances is common.

## Objective
To design a low-cost, reliable, and real-time alert system that:
- Detects high temperature on an iron plate  
- Senses nearby hand presence  
- Warns users through a buzzer before contact  

---

## Components Used
- **Arduino Nano** – Main controller (compact and efficient)
- **Thermistor** – For temperature measurement
- **IR Proximity Sensor** – To detect hand presence
- **Buzzer** – For audio alert
- **Connecting wires & power supply**

---

## Working Principle
1. The **thermistor continuously measures the temperature** of the iron plate.  
2. The **IR sensor detects if a hand is near the plate.**  
3. If:
   - Temperature is above the safe limit **AND**
   - A hand is detected nearby  
   → The **buzzer turns ON** to warn the user.
